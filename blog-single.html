                  The theme of Mark 15:34 is the cry of dereliction, the expression of the anguish and abandonment that Jesus felt on the cross when he bore the sins of the world and was forsaken by his Father. This cry echoes the words of Psalm 22:1, a psalm that vividly portrays the suffering and glory of the Messiah. In this text, I will provide an exegesis of Psalm 22, using the insights of C.S. Lewis, Charles Spurgeon, and some of the apologists who have ever written about this psalm.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Psalm 22 is a remarkable prophecy of the crucifixion of Christ, written by David about a thousand years before it happened. It begins with a lament, in which the psalmist complains of his distance from God, his lack of deliverance, his mockery by enemies, and his physical agony. He describes his condition in terms that correspond to the details of the gospel accounts: his thirst (v. 15), his pierced hands and feet (v. 16), his exposed bones (v. 17), and his divided garments (v. 18). He pleads with God to rescue him from the sword, the dog, the lion, and the horns of the wild oxen, which are metaphors for his enemies and their instruments of torture.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <h3>Change of tone</h3>

                <p>
                  But in verse 21, there is a sudden change of tone. The psalmist declares that God has answered him and delivered him from death. He then vows to praise God and to proclaim his name to his brethren, to the congregation, and to all the ends of the earth. He foresees that future generations will worship God and acknowledge his righteousness and salvation. He ends with a triumphant affirmation: "He has done it!" (v. 31).
                </p>

                
                <p>
                  How can we explain this dramatic shift from despair to joy, from death to life? C.S. Lewis suggests that it is a glimpse of the resurrection, the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death. He writes: "The meaning is plain enough. The speaker has been saved from some enormous calamity; saved at the very last moment when hope had died in him and he had given up all expectation but that of being slowly tortured to death... But more than that; he feels that all this miracle has happened for a purpose; that he himself is a sign or instrument or first-fruits or representative of something beyond his own destiny; something which is good news for all men." (Reflections on the Psalms) 
                </p>

                <h3>Prophecy in disguise</h3>
                <p>
                  Charles Spurgeon agrees that this psalm is a prophecy of Christ's resurrection and its implications for his people. He says: "This is beyond all others THE PSALM OF THE CROSS... Before us we have a description both of the darkness and of the glory of the cross, the sufferings of Christ and the glory which shall follow... The scene enacted at Calvary was but a visible symbol of what transpired within our Lord's heart; here we have set forth what he really endured." (The Treasury of David)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other apologists have also pointed out how this psalm confirms the truth and uniqueness of Christianity. They have shown how it fulfills many Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, how it anticipates many New Testament doctrines about Christ's atonement and kingdom, and how it challenges many false religions and philosophies that deny Christ's deity, humanity, or sacrifice. They have also applied this psalm to our own experience as Christians, encouraging us to trust God in our trials, to identify with Christ in his sufferings, and to rejoice in his resurrection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As followers of Jesus, we can learn from both David and Jesus how to deal with our own trials and sufferings. We can be honest with God about our feelings and doubts, but we can also cling to his promises and character. </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>

                  </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>We can look to Jesus as our example and source of strength, who sympathizes with our weaknesses and intercedes for us (Hebrews 4:15-16; Romans 8:34). We can rejoice in the hope of glory, knowing that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us (Romans 8:18). We can join with Jesus in praising God and declaring his name to others, knowing that he has done it! (Psalm 22:31).

                <h3>What are some of the lessons you can draw from the psalm 22</h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing you can notice about Psalm 22 is its structure, which is very unique. It consists of two main parts: verses 1-21 describe the sufferings of the psalmist, while verses 22-31 celebrate his deliverance and praise God for his salvation. The psalm begins and ends with a reference to God as "my God", indicating a personal relationship that is tested but not broken by the ordeal. The psalm also alternates between complaint and confidence, despair and hope, petition and praise. This reflects the emotional turmoil of the psalmist, but also his faith that God will ultimately vindicate him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second thing to notice is the vivid imagery that the psalmist uses to portray his distress. He compares himself to a worm (v. 6), a hunted animal (v. 16), a poured out water (v. 14), a broken pot (v. 15), and a sacrificial lamb (v. 16). He also describes his enemies as bulls, lions, dogs, and wild oxen (vv. 12-13, 16, 21). These metaphors convey the intensity of his pain, humiliation, isolation, and vulnerability. They also foreshadow the sufferings of Christ, who was despised, rejected, mocked, scourged, crucified, and pierced for our transgressions.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The third thing to notice is the prophetic nature of the psalm. Many details of the psalmist's ordeal correspond to the events of Christ's passion. For example, he is surrounded by enemies who mock him and challenge him to trust in God (vv. 7-8; cf. Matt. 27:39-43); he is stripped of his clothes and they cast lots for them (v. 18; cf. John 19:23-24); he cries out to God but receives no answer (v. 2; cf. Matt. 27:46); he commits his spirit into God's hands (v. 20; cf. Luke 23:46); and he is rescued from death and declares God's name to his brethren (vv. 21-22; cf. Heb. 2:12). These similarities suggest that Psalm 22 is not only a record of David's experience, but also a prophecy of Christ's sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lewis, commenting on this remarkable coincidence, says: "The most striking thing about this prophecy is that it does not seem to be a prophecy at all ... It looks as if it were simply an account of something that had actually happened ... It is as if we overheard David talking about something that had happened to himself yesterday" (p. 93). Lewis suggests that this is an example of what he calls "second meanings" in Scripture: "the meaning which comes out when we apply it to something more than David" (p. 94). He argues that these second meanings are not arbitrary or fanciful, but intended by God from the beginning: "The human qualities of the raw materials show through ... Yet they are all transparent to something more than human" (p. 95).

                </p>
                <p>
                  In conclusion, Psalm 22 is a powerful testimony to the person and work of Christ, who suffered for our sins and rose for our justification. It reveals both his humanity and his divinity, both his weakness and his strength, both his agony and his glory. It invites us to join him in his praise and proclamation of God's name, to share in his sufferings and glory, and to celebrate his victory over sin and death.
